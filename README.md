# A pulumi provider for Honeycomb.io

This provider is based on the [honeycomb terraform
provider](https://github.com/honeycombio/terraform-provider-honeycombio),
and is currently in an experimental state.

I would tell you to look in `examples/` for things you could try out,
but those are not set up yet... Just like the rest of the provider,
which is completely untested at the moment. Feel free to try it &
report issues, though!
